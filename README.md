📚 What I Learned
Building this personal portfolio from scratch helped me strengthen:

🧠 My understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals

✨ DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates using JavaScript

🌙 Toggling features like dark mode with responsive design

⚙️ Integrating third-party services like EmailJS

🌐 Hosting static sites using Netlify and managing file structures

📄 Embedding and linking PDFs, project files, and media

🧩 Debugging layout issues across screen sizes using media queries

🛠️ Organizing code in a way that’s reusable and maintainable

This project also gave me real-world practice in designing, deploying, and documenting a complete frontend application.
